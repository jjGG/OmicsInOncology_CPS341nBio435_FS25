# Introduction

In this R-challenge we would first like to reproduce a volcano plot from an article using the provided supplementary data and then apply some of the skills we have learned in the previous weeks. Basically, in the same article, the authors also provide a matrix with the expression of the proteins in the surfaceome of multiple myeloma cells. We will try to visualize this matrix as a heatmap, a correlation heatmap or a PCA/MDS plot.

__Article: The surfaceome of multiple myeloma cells suggests potential immunotherapeutic strategies and protein markers of drug resistance__
DOI: 10.1038/s41467-022-31810-6

The article "The surfaceome of multiple myeloma cells suggests potential immunotherapeutic strategies and protein markers of drug resistance" by Ferguson et al. presents a comprehensive investigation of the surface proteome, or surfaceome, of multiple myeloma cells. This study is pivotal as it explores how the surfaceome influences the interaction between tumor cells and their microenvironment, making it a critical area for potential therapeutic advancements and understanding drug resistance mechanisms [@Ferguson2022-sc].

The authors employed glycoprotein capture proteomics to systematically characterize the myeloma surfaceome under various conditions: at baseline, when facing drug resistance, and in response to acute drug treatments. This methodology allowed for a detailed examination of surface antigens that could be targeted for immunotherapy. The findings from this study include the establishment of a scoring system to evaluate and prioritize these surface antigens based on their potential therapeutic value [@Ferguson2022-sc].

One of the most significant outcomes of the study is the identification of CCR10 as a promising target for immunotherapeutic intervention. The expression of CCR10 was noted to be prevalent among malignant plasma cells, suggesting that therapies targeting this marker could enhance treatment efficacy. This provides a strategic direction for developing new immunotherapies aimed specifically at overcoming the challenges associated with drug resistance in multiple myeloma [@Ferguson2022-sc].

Overall, the article provides vital insights into the complexity of the myeloma surfaceome and reinforces the need for continued exploration into targeted therapies that can improve clinical outcomes in patients suffering from multiple myeloma.

## Libraries used for this tutorial:
You may not need all of these listed here.

- tidyr, dplyr: data handling from the tidyverse
- magrittr: together with tidyverse it allows the use of %&lt;&gt;%
- readxl and openxlsx: libraries to open and write microsoft excel files
- ggplot2: produce nice plots
- pheatmap: to great nice (pretty) heatmaps from matrices
- ggtree: to plot phylogenetic trees
- ape: to read and manipulate phylogenetic trees
- viridis: to get nice color scales
- DESeq2, plotly, limma, SummarizedExperiment: to generate similar QC plots as in week 2
- ggrepel: to avoid overplotting of labels in ggplot2

## Idea in this R-challenge:
* Find the excel sheet, look at it, see what is relevant and then try to do the coding
* One sheet in this excel book is relevant but only part of it, try to restructure it R the way you need it
* Try to use AI in this challenge at multiple steps (restructure the data, plotting w/ ggplot) if it is not immediately obvious to you how to do it.

# Goal 1: Redo Figure 1E from the article

Below here we show the Figure 1E from the article. We will try to reproduce this figure with the data provided in as supplement in an excel file.
_Try first to understand what this plot is showing. And explain it here, also indicate what columns are potentially relevant in this sheet (not all of them you need to use). Something like: on this volcano we see THE Log2-fold change in surface-protein expression on the x-axis (change between multiple myeloma cells and B-ALL) while on the y-axis the p value of each change is depicted. We can see in this plot that proteins like CD19, CD72 en FLT3 are significantly lower abundant on MM vs B-all and that GGT1, SELPL, ICAM1 etc. are significantly higher abundant on the cell surface of MM cells   _

    color = "blue",  # Color the labels blue
    show.legend = FALSE  # Remove "Labeled" category from legend
  )
  
```

# Goal 2: Try to visualize the expression matrix as a heatmap and make some QC plots

The authors of the article also provide a matrix with the expression of the proteins in the surfaceome of multiple myeloma cells. 
Please also remember the QC-plots from week 3. We will try to visualize this matrix as a heatmap and do some more QC plots such as correlation heatmap or a PCA/MDS plot.


```{r look at excel sheet again and get matrix out, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
# Do you find a pattern that matches all the columns that you want? yes, al proteins are grouped) There is a regEx pattern that matches the columns of interest
dat_wide <- dat |> select(Protein, matches("\\.\\d+$"))
head(dat_wide)
```
First some reshaping is necessairy again.

### A heatmap with clustering 

```{r pheatmap, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# use the pheatmap package. It works on wide format
# Generate the heatmap with clustering (using pheatmap)

# Check for duplicate protein names
duplicated_proteins <- duplicated(dat_wide$Protein)

# If there are duplicates, create unique names
if (any(duplicated_proteins)) {
  dat_wide$Protein <- make.unique(as.character(dat_wide$Protein))
}

# Convert the protein names to row names
dat_wide_matrix <- dat_wide |> column_to_rownames(var = "Protein")

# Check the first few rows to verify
head(dat_wide_matrix)

# Generate the heatmap with clustering
pheatmap(dat_wide_matrix, 
         scale = "row",  # Scale the data by column (protein)
         clustering_distance_rows = "euclidean",  # Hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distance for rows
         clustering_distance_cols = "euclidean",  # Hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distance for columns
         clustering_method = "complete",  # Complete linkage for clustering
         show_rownames = FALSE,  # Hide row names (optional)
         show_colnames = TRUE,  # Show column names (optional)
         color = colorRampPalette(c("green", "blue", "yellow"))(100),  # Color scale from blue to red
         main = "Protein Expression Heatmap"
)
```

### A Correlation-Heatmap

```{r correlation plot or pca, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# corr
# Compute the correlation matrix (without scaling)
cor_matrix <- cor(dat_wide_matrix, method = "pearson")  # You can use "spearman" or "kendall" if needed

# Generate the correlation heatmap with adjusted size and smoother colors
pheatmap(cor_matrix, 
         clustering_distance_rows = "euclidean",  # Use Euclidean distance for rows
         clustering_distance_cols = "euclidean",  # Use Euclidean distance for columns
         clustering_method = "complete",  # Complete linkage for clustering
         show_rownames = TRUE,  # Show row names
         show_colnames = TRUE,  # Show column names
         color = colorRampPalette(c("blue", "green", "yellow"))(1000),  # Smooth color gradient with more colors
         main = "Protein Expression Correlation Heatmap",
         legend = TRUE,   # Show legend for the correlations
         fontsize_row = 6,  # Reduce row name font size to avoid cramming
         fontsize_col = 6,  # Reduce column name font size (optional)
         height = 10,  # Adjust height of the plot (increased for readability)
         width = 12,   # Adjust width of the plot
         border_color = "azure3" # remove the gray borders around each cell
)
```

## Some QC plots like in week 3

### First again some reshaping
Here we take the recipe from week 3 and apply it to the data we have here.
Important here is that the __protein names__ are redundant that causes problems. 
Therefore we take the Uniprot_ID instead of the protein names to generate the SummarizedExperiment object.

```{r qc plots ala week3 prepare it, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# extract again relevant columns but here UniProt Ids (since unique) for all rows
dat_wide2 <- dat |> select(Uniprot_ID, matches("\\.\\d+$"))
# only quantitative matrix in a data frame and uniprot Ids as rownames
qMat <- dat_wide2 %>% select(-Uniprot_ID)
rownames(qMat) <- dat_wide$UniProt_ID
# qMat should have integer values to minimize rounding effect errors we multiply it with 100
qMat100 <- round(qMat*100, 0)


# extract conditions (cell types) from column names with regular expression
cellTypes <- gsub("\\.\\d+$", "", colnames(qMat100))

# Define meta dataframe for later use
meta <- data.frame(
  Condition=as.factor(cellTypes),
  row.names=colnames(qMat100)
)

conditionColours <- scales::hue_pal()(length(unique(meta$Condition)))
names(conditionColours) <- unique(meta$Condition)
sampleColours <- conditionColours[meta$Condition]

dds <- DESeq2::DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=qMat100,
                                      colData=meta,
                                      design=~Condition)
vsd <- DESeq2::vst(dds)

# Extract normalized counts
vsdSE <- SummarizedExperiment::assay(vsd)
```
### PCA and MDS plots like in Week 3

```{r PCA plot, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Do PCA
# Perform PCA on variance-stabilized data (vsdSE)
pca_res <- prcomp(t(vsdSE))  # Transpose the data matrix to have samples as rows

# Extract PCA results for plotting
pca_data <- as.data.frame(pca_res$x)  # Principal component scores (coordinates)

# Add condition labels to the PCA data
pca_data$Condition <- meta$Condition

# Create the PCA plot
ggplot(pca_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Condition)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  scale_color_manual(values = conditionColours) +  # Color based on conditions
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "PCA Plot of Protein Expression Data",
       x = paste("PC1 (", round(100 * summary(pca_res)$importance[2, 1]), "%)", sep = ""),
       y = paste("PC2 (", round(100 * summary(pca_res)$importance[2, 2]), "%)", sep = "")) +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())

```

### Correlation plot like in week 3

```{r corrPlot like in week 3, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Pearson correlation plot

# Compute Pearson correlation matrix for the variance-stabilized data (vsdSE)
cor_matrix <- cor(vsdSE, method = "pearson")

# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(RColorBrewer)

# Reshape the correlation matrix for ggplot
cor_matrix_melted <- melt(cor_matrix)

# Create a Pearson correlation heatmap
ggplot(cor_matrix_melted, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +  # Use tiles to visualize correlation
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", high = "yellow", mid = "green", midpoint = 0, 
                       limits = c(-1, 1), name = "Correlation") +  # Color scale
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Pearson Correlation Heatmap of Protein Expression Data",
       x = "Samples", y = "Samples") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),  # Rotate x-axis labels
        axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1)) +  # Keep y-axis labels horizontal
  coord_fixed()  # Fix aspect ratio to make it square
```
